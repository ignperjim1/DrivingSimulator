# DrivingSimulator
A driving simulator to test movement, transforms and rotations on 3D models. Visual assets obtained from the marketplace.

Each of the .zip will be used to play a different scene of the game, so be careful and don't mix the files, just in case something might fail. Uncompress them in different folders and run the .exe to play each of the scenes.
